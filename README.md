# 14-challenge
 Creating an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets.


## Technologies
Using the Conda package manager: [My GitHub Project](https://github.com/ALovettII/14-challenge.git)

To use this project, you will need the following libraries:
* import pandas as pd
* import numpy as np
* from pathlib import Path
* import hvplot.pandas
* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* from sklearn import svm
* from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
* from pandas.tseries.offsets import DateOffset
* from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
* from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier


## Usage
The goal of this project is to create an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets.

Procedural Steps Followed:
1. Establish a Baseline Performance
2. Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm
3. Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier
4. Create an Evaluation Report

To modify this code for your own use:
* Change the import variable `ohlcv_df` to upload your data
* Ensure that the columns are renamed to match the Notebook


## Evaluation Analysis
| Model Name | Accuracy Average | Cumulative Return |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Baseline (SVM) |
| Tuned SVM |
| RandomForest |
